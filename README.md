## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Javascript

### Continued development

- Utilizing relevant semantic practices
- Working with flexbox for element positioning
- Intermediate CSS for button styling and animations
- Exercising JS logic and mastering DOM manipulation

### Improvements

- Exploring the use of CSS grid to accomplish even positioning in css. I feel that css grid could have made the process of designing a calculator much easier than solely flexbox alone.
- Furthering my understanding of JavaScript and algorithms to make effecient functions for the functionality of my programs.
